"""Admin dashboard API — thin aggregator that includes all sub-routers.

Sub-routers:
  analytics_router    — overview, metrics, timeseries, routing, model compare
  conversations_router — conversations, sessions, feedback, PII stats
  training_router     — training runs, distillation, Argilla, import
  providers_router    — providers, accounts, Ollama, servers, playground
  agents_router       — agents, applications, workspaces
  plans_router        — planning API

The WebSocket live-feed stays here because it has special auth handling
(query-param token instead of Authorization header).
